1. Open the whole folder in VSC. (After my practice, I found that if I open main.py 
    directly in the resource manager, there will be an error that "test.csv" or 
    "train.csv" can not be found.)
2. Run main.py. It is the main entrance of all the codes of our group. 
    You can run all the codes with it.
3. Enter the keyword to see the output of the code you want to see.
4. keywords:
    Number 1,2,3: View the output of different versions of the prepruning program.
    Number 4,5: View the output of unpruned program for different data scale training groups.
    Number 6: View the process of postpruning.
